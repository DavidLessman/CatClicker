# Cat Clicker game
optional project during Udacity Frontend Dev Course.

## Instructions

after loading the index.html file, you simply click on the cat and your score will increase.

#### Part 2 Cat Clicker Duo
so now I need to have 2 cats, each with a name and number of clicks.

## plans

currently pretty simple. going to work through the improvements suggested during this assignment. 

if not addressed:
- improving the styling with the css. 
- error message when clicking on screen but not on the cat
- timer?
- end game options?

## contributions

placekitten.com providing the image of the cat that's being used.
