# Cat Clicker game
optional project during Udacity Frontend Dev Course.

## Instructions

after loading the index.html file, you simply click on the cat and your score will increase.

#### Part 2 Cat Clicker Duo
~~so now I need to have 2 cats, each with a name and number of clicks.~~

Two cats displaying now. Each has a name and it's own counter. Total score at the top.

## plans

~~currently pretty simple.~~
less simple now. about to see where part 3 takes me.

going to work through the improvements suggested during this assignment. 

if not addressed:
- improving the styling with the css. 
- error message when clicking on screen but not on the cat
- timer?
- end game options?
